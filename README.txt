Luna Turquesa - simple static site
---------------------------------
Files:
 - index.html   (main page)
 - styles.css   (styling)

How to use (3 easy ways):
1) GitHub Pages (free, no ads)
   - Create a new public repo on GitHub
   - Upload these files to the repo root
   - In repo Settings -> Pages choose branch 'main' and folder '/ (root)' then save
   - Your site will be served at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name> within minutes

2) Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages (free tiers)
   - Create an account, drag-and-drop the site folder (or connect the GitHub repo) and deploy.
   - These hosts do not inject ads.

3) Serve locally or any static host
   - Open index.html in your browser to preview.
   - Or upload to any hosting provider that serves static files.

Note:
 - Replace phone/email/social links in index.html with your real ones.
 - This site is pure HTML+CSS (no tracking, no ads). If you use a free site-builder like Wix or some free plans, they may insert their own branding/ads. Use GitHub Pages / Netlify / Google Sites for ad-free pages.
